# Go Project Architecture
Follow the full rules in:
- `@.ai-context/rules/project_architecture.md`
- `@ai_go/v1/rules/project_architecture.md`

## Key MUSTs
- Keep dependencies inward; inner layers MUST NOT import outer layers.
- Forbid cyclic dependencies between packages.
- Define interfaces in the consuming layer; inject dependencies explicitly.
- Keep domain models independent of transport/persistence.
- Separate handlers, usecases/services, domain, and infra.
- Validate external input at the boundary and map to domain types.
- Check `docs/design` and update or add design documentation when service logic changed
