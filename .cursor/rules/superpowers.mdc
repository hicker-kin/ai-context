# Superpowers Development Workflow

Follow the development workflow defined in `@.superpowers`. **Scope and conditions apply.**

## When to Use Full Workflow (brainstorming → spec → plan → TDD → review)

Apply when:

- Creating **new features** or **new components**
- Adding **new functionality** or **significant behavior changes**
- The user says "build X", "add feature Y", "implement Z"

## When to Use Debugging Workflow (no brainstorming)

Apply when:

- **Bug fixes**, **test failures**, or **unexpected behavior**
- Use `@.superpowers/skills/systematic-debugging/` first: find root cause, then fix
- Still use TDD for the fix and code review before completion

## When to Use Minimal Workflow

Apply when:

- **Refactors** (rename, extract, move): brief plan + confirmation, then TDD
- **Formatting / typos / docs-only**: no spec needed; confirm scope and proceed

## You MUST (by scope)

| Scope      | Brainstorming | Spec/Plan | Confirmation | TDD | Code Review |
|------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| New feature| ✓             | ✓         | ✓            | ✓   | ✓           |
| Bug fix    | ✗ (use systematic-debugging) | brief root-cause notes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Refactor   | ✗             | brief     | ✓            | ✓   | ✓           |
| Trivial    | ✗             | ✗         | ✓            | ✗   | optional    |

## Never Do

- Directly implement features without a plan or confirmation
- Skip root-cause investigation for bugs (use systematic-debugging first)

## Reference

- `skills/brainstorming/` – clarify intent, requirements, design before implementation
- `skills/systematic-debugging/` – root cause before fixes (bug path)
- `skills/writing-plans/` – break work into tasks with file paths and verification steps
- `skills/test-driven-development/` – RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- `skills/requesting-code-review/` – review against plan before merging
