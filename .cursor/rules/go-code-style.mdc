# Go Code Style (Summary)
Follow the full rules in:
- `@.ai-context/rules/code_style.md`
- `@ai_go/v1/rules/code_style.md`

## Key MUSTs
- Run `gofmt -s` (and prefer `goimports`).
- All coding rules must follow the Formatting and Naming rules in code style.
- Avoid repeating receiver or package names in functions.
- Return `error` last; wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`.
- Prefer guard clauses and small, focused functions.
- Exported identifiers need proper godoc comments.
- `context.Context` is the first param; do not store it in structs.
- Prevent goroutine leaks; do not copy `sync.Mutex`/`sync.WaitGroup`.
- Request DTOs must set `json` tags and `binding` rules.
